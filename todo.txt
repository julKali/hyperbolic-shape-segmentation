see if collapses at border => doesnt look like it
try dim=40 => still eucl is better
try hierarchical sigmoid
try with classes
visualise 2d disk
cones?

TODO:
-- train & visualize 2D
-- use pointne v1 => done
-- use hierarchical softmax and cross entropy => done

-- check that ||class_emb|| < ||inst_emb|| for inst of class => not the case
-- try 2D, check if collapses at border ...
-- eucl with hierarchical loss => done, ~ same best
-- try different curvatures !
-- try less points => faster training, if combined with bigger batch size
